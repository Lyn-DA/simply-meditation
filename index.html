                    <hr>
                    <p>The purpose of meditation is to cultivate positive mental states and overcome negative habits. Through meditation we learn that happiness is a state of mind and that the real source of happiness lies within, not in external situations. When our mind is peaceful we are free from worries and mental discomfort, and we experience true happiness. Meditation is the method to make our mind peaceful and can be practiced by anyone. <br> <br> 10 Reasons to Meditate: (1) Reduced stress, (2) Improved memory, (3) Increased attention, (4) Enhanced will power, (5) Better sleep, (6) Reduce pain, (7) Lower blood pressure, (8) Reduce anxiety, (9) Reduce depression, (10) Greater compassion.

                    <p>The meditation you teach, Lynda, is way beyond relaxation or a practice of even a lifestyle.</p>
                    <hr class="space">
                    <p>To me, it is more about training my mind to let go and be in a state of non-judgment so my conscious awareness can expand.</p>
                    <hr class="space">
                    <p>I find through attending your Simply Meditation classes that I am ultimately tapping into something so inherently deep, beautiful and peaceful within me.</p>
                    <hr class="space"> 
                    <p>The greatest benefit so far (which I never saw coming) is that meditation has stirred up within me a thirst and a yearning to go inside myself and discover the mysteries within. It has been magic!

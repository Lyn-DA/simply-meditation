Simply Meditation is a website designed to promote a number of meditation classes in Dublin city provided by Simply Meditation Wellness Centre. As well as a space to list their meditation classes and provide additional information regarding different meditation styles and techniques covered by the centre, the site is also aesthetically designed to promote meditation as a way to bring more peace, calm and balance into one's everyday life. The site will target individuals who are looking to find a place that teaches meditation in a group setting from beginner level to more advanced meditation practices. Simply Meditation will be a user-friendly site which is easy to navigate for new users and returning users to find out exactly what meditation classes are on what day and at what time. The site will also promote Simply Meditation Wellness Centre as a warm welcoming environment and a space where users feel comfortable getting in touch to ask questions about meditation in general and/or the types of meditation classes that are being advertised.

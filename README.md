# Simply Meditation
Developer - Lynda Phelan

Simply Meditation is a website designed to promote a number of meditation classes in Dublin city provided by Simply Meditation Wellness Centre. As well as a space to list their meditation classes and provide additional information regarding different meditation styles and techniques covered by the centre, the site is also aesthetically designed to promote meditation as a way to bring more peace, calm and balance into one's everyday life. The site will target individuals who are looking to find a place that teaches meditation in a group setting from beginner level to more advanced meditation practices. Simply Meditation will be a user-friendly site which is easy to navigate for new users and returning users to find out exactly what meditation classes are on what day and at what time. The site will also promote Simply Meditation Wellness Centre as a warm welcoming environment and a space where users feel comfortable getting in touch to ask questions about meditation in general and/or the types of meditation classes that are being advertised.

## Design

### Design Choices
The website was designed to promote feelings of calm, peace, tranquility as well as togetherness. The overall look and feel of the site promotes the benefits of meditation on an individual level and on a social level. The images used and the visual space provided on the site promote the idea of expansion and balance.

### Colour
The colour scheme is both warm in some instances and cool in others. This play between both ends of the spectrum promotes a feeling of balance between warm and cool energies, which encourages an overall sense of peace and calm. The underlining message suggests that practicing meditation balances mind, body and soul.

### Fonts
- Quicksand was used for the body and Grandstander for headings.
- Grandstander was chosen to play off the logo font-family which is not available as a free font. 
- Quicksand was chosen for the body for accessibility reasons. 

### Structure
The website is structured in such a way that upon opening any of the pages, the user is immediately greeted with a familiar and user friendly structure including the business logo which is linked to homepage located on the top left, and an easy to navigate navigation bar located to the right of the logo.
The website consists of three separate pages: 
- A homepage with information about the business, general information about meditation, directions to find further information, a student testimonial, and a form to sign up to a newsletter, plus social media links

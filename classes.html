                    <h3>Guided Meditation</h3>
                    <hr class="space">
                    <p>This is possibly the most common form of meditation used in western society. It is when your imagination is lead on a journey to achieve healing and realisation through focused thought and reflection.
                        The idea is to let go of any thought you may have and allow your subconscious mind to follow the words that are spoken. It allows the mind to leave negative thought
                        patterns behind and focus on the experience of the visualisation. Guided Meditation can help you achieve deep
                        relaxation and release negative emotions or beliefs that may be preventing you from experiencing peace and calm.

                    <h3>Concentrative</h3>
                    <hr class="space">
                    <p>Concentrative meditation requires us to focus our attention. It may be on our breath, an image, a sound or a mantra, with the intention of stilling the mind and allowing a greater awareness and clarity to surface. The most basic form of concentrative meditation is to sit quietly and focus on our breath. During concentrative meditation, we do not entertain any thought, planning or remembering. We focus all our thought on the object (or chant); when other thoughts enter our mind, we acknowledge them and return our focus. We are completely with the experience (sound, object activity).
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Open Awareness</h3>
                    <hr class="space">
                    <p>This style of meditation involves opening our awareness to the endless procession of
                        thoughts, sounds, sensations, images, smells, and feelings that we are experiencing, without
                        becoming involved in thinking about them. We sit quietly and simply witnesses what goes through our mind, without reacting or
                        becoming caught up in or building on those thoughts, worries, memories, or images. This helps train the brain to become more calm, clear, and non-reactive.
                        This style of meditation is experiencing what is happening in the here and now. It is the art of being fully present.

                    <h3>Trataka</h3>
                    <hr class="space">
                    <p>Trataka meditation, also known as candle-gazing meditation, is a meditation technique in which the practitioner focuses on a single visual point. The point may be an image, a word, a symbol, or even just a dot on the wall. The idea is to allow the gaze to soften and rest gently on this point, so that the mind can relax.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Mantra</h3>
                    <hr class="space">
                    <p>Mantras include syllables, words, or phrases that need to be repeated in a particular fashion during meditation. Mantras may be chanted, whispered, spoken, sung, or simply repeated along with deep meditation. Mantra meditation involves the energy of sound to achieve harmonious unity and connection with the self and beyond.</p>

                    <h3>Mindfulness</h3>
                    <hr class="space">
                    <p>Mindfulness is a type of meditation in which you focus on being intensely aware of what you're sensing, feeling and thinking in the moment, without interpretation or judgment. Practicing mindfulness involves breathing methods, guided imagery, and other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress.</p>

                    <hr class="space">
                    <p>Zen meditation, also known as Zazen, is a technique rooted in Buddhist psychology. The goal of Zen meditation is to regulate attention. It is sometimes referred to as a practice that involves “thinking about not thinking.” Zen meditation is an 'open awareness' style of meditation. Zen is about focusing on being present.</p>

                    <h3>Body Scan</h3>
                    <hr class="space">
                    <p>The body scan meditation focuses attention on physical sensations in the body. The practice is completed by “scanning” one is awareness through the entire body on a micro level. Attention is given to every inch of the body. The purpose of this practice is to cultivate the ability to notice what is being experienced in the body.</p>
